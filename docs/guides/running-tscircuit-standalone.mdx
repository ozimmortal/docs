title: Running tscircuit with a script tag
description: Load `@tscircuit/runframe`'s standalone build from a CDN and render a circuit written inside a `<script type="tscircuit-tsx">` block – no build tooling required.
---

## Overview

The `@tscircuit/runframe` package ships a single-file distribution (`standalone.min.js`) that can be loaded directly in the browser.  
When this file is present on the page it will look for any `<script>` tags with the special type `tscircuit-tsx`, compile the content on-the-fly, and mount the rendered circuit into the page body.

This makes it possible to embed tscircuit examples in any static HTML page without Webpack, Vite, or a React build step.

Here's a minimal **stand-alone** HTML page that renders a resistor inside a board:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script>
      /* React & friends sometimes look at process.env.NODE_ENV – define it so they stay quiet */
      window.process = { env: { NODE_ENV: "production" } }
    </script>

    <!-- Pull the latest standalone bundle from jsDelivr -->
    <script
      type="module"
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tscircuit/runframe@0.0.712/dist/standalone.min.js"
    ></script>

    <!-- Your tscircuit snippet goes here -->
    <script type="tscircuit-tsx">
      export default () => (
        <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
          <resistor name="R1" resistance={1000} footprint={"0402"} />
        </board>
      )
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

The first script tag simply provides a minimal `process.env` shim required by React.  
The second script tag downloads the standalone bundle which brings in React, tscircuit, and the on-page compiler.  
Finally, the third script tag contains the JSX (technically TSX) that defines your circuit.  
When the browser finishes parsing, `standalone.min.js` compiles this TSX and injects the resulting circuit right where the script tag is placed (the default is the end of the `<body>` tag).

## Live example

Below is the same snippet executed inside an **actual `<iframe>`** (no special React wrapper is used). The entire HTML page is provided via the `srcDoc` attribute so you can inspect, copy, and modify it as needed:

<iframe
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "600px", border: "1px solid #ccc" }}
  srcDoc={`
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script>
      window.process = { env: { NODE_ENV: "production" } }
    </script>
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tscircuit/runframe@latest/dist/standalone.min.js"></script>
    <script type="tscircuit-tsx">
      export default () => (
        <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
          <resistor name="R1" resistance={1000} footprint={"0402"} />
        </board>
      )
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>`}
/>

*(If you don't see anything, your browser or an extension may be blocking third-party scripts. Try opening the HTML snippet in a separate tab to verify it renders correctly.)*

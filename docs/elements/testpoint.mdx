## Overview

A `<testpoint />` is a designated location on a PCB that provides easy access for testing, debugging, and measuring electrical signals. Test points are essential for troubleshooting circuits and verifying proper operation during development and manufacturing.

Test points can be implemented as surface-mount pads or through-hole connections, depending on the testing requirements and available board space. They provide a reliable connection point for oscilloscope probes, multimeter leads, and other test equipment.

When designing test points, consider the size and shape based on your testing needs and the type of probes you'll be using.

export default () => (
    <testpoint

## Pins

A test point has a single connection:

| Pin # | Aliases | Description |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| pin1 | tp, test | The test point connection |

## Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description | Example |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `footprintVariant` | `"pad" \| "through_hole"` | No | Type of test point implementation | `"pad"`, `"through_hole"` |
| `padShape` | `"rect" \| "circle"` | No | Shape of the test point pad (default: "circle") | `"circle"`, `"rect"` |
| `padDiameter` | `string \| number` | No | Diameter of circular test point pads | `"1mm"`, `0.5` |
| `holeDiameter` | `string \| number` | No | Diameter of hole for through-hole test points | `"0.8mm"`, `0.3` |
| `width` | `string \| number` | No | Width of rectangular test point pads | `"2mm"`, `1.5` |
| `height` | `string \| number` | No | Height of rectangular test point pads | `"1mm"`, `0.8` |
| `layer` | `"top" \| "bottom"` | No | PCB layer where the test point is placed (default: "top") | `"bottom"` |

## Footprint Variants

### Surface Mount Pad (`footprintVariant="pad"`)
Surface mount test points are implemented as exposed copper pads on the PCB surface. They're compact and suitable for most testing scenarios.

**Advantages:**
- Minimal board space required
- No drilling needed during manufacturing
- Suitable for automated testing

**Use cases:**
- High-density designs
- Automated test equipment (ATE)
- Quick voltage measurements

### Through-Hole (`footprintVariant="through_hole"`)
Through-hole test points provide a drilled hole that can accommodate test pins or spring-loaded probes more reliably.

**Advantages:**
- Better probe retention
- More reliable connection
- Suitable for repeated testing

**Use cases:**
- Manual testing and debugging
- Prototype development
- Test fixtures requiring secure connections

## Pad Shapes

### Circle (`padShape="circle"`)
Circular test points are the most common and provide good probe contact from any angle.

```jsx
<testpoint
  name="TP1"
  footprintVariant="pad"
  padShape="circle"
  padDiameter="1mm"
/>
```

### Rectangle (`padShape="rect"`)
Rectangular test points can provide more surface area in constrained spaces.

```jsx
<testpoint
  name="TP2"
  footprintVariant="pad"
  padShape="rect"
  width="1.5mm"
  height="0.8mm"
/>
```

## Sizing Guidelines

### Pad Diameter/Size
- **Small**: 0.5mm - 0.8mm (for high-density boards)
- **Medium**: 1mm - 1.5mm (standard testing)
- **Large**: 2mm+ (for easy manual probing)

### Hole Diameter (Through-hole)
- **Standard**: 0.8mm - 1mm
- **Large probes**: 1.2mm - 1.5mm

## Usage Examples

### Basic Voltage Test Point
```jsx
<testpoint name="VCC_TP" />
```

### Bottom Layer Test Point
```jsx
<testpoint name="GND_TP" layer="bottom" />
```

### Custom Circular Pad
```jsx
<testpoint
  name="SIG_TP"
  footprintVariant="pad"
  padShape="circle"
  padDiameter="1.2mm"
/>
```

### Through-hole Test Point
```jsx
<testpoint
  name="DEBUG_TP"
  footprintVariant="through_hole"
  holeDiameter="1mm"
  padDiameter="2mm"
/>
```

### Rectangular Test Point
```jsx
<testpoint
  name="COMPACT_TP"
  footprintVariant="pad"
  padShape="rect"
  width="1.5mm"
  height="0.8mm"
/>
```
## Testing Considerations

- **Probe compatibility**: Choose sizes compatible with your test equipment
- **Spacing**: Ensure adequate spacing between test points for probe access
- **Labeling**: Use clear, descriptive names for easy identification
- **Documentation**: Include test point locations in assembly drawings and test procedures

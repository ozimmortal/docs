title: Building a Custom Keyboard
---

## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll walk through building a custom keyboard using tscircuit.
We'll start by creating a simple 4-key macropad with pushbuttons and a microcontroller.
We'll then replace the pushbuttons with mechanical switches and diodes, then expand on our simple keyboard to a full 60% keyboard
design with custom mounting holes and "matrix scanning" to detect key presses.

## Starting Simple: A 4-key Pushbutton Macropad

Let's start by creating a simple 4-key macropad with pushbuttons. Pushbuttons
are commonly available and builtin to tscircuit via the `<pushbutton />` element.

## Building Large Keyboards with Matrix Scanning

A keyboard is essentially a matrix of switches that are scanned by a microcontroller to detect key presses. Each key consists of:
- A mechanical switch
- A diode to prevent "ghosting" (unwanted keypress detection)

The switches are arranged in rows and columns, with the microcontroller scanning each intersection to determine which keys are pressed.

## Building the Circuit

Let's start by creating a basic 2x2 matrix keyboard:
